 ls5000 SANE backend
=====================

Author: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>
Based on coolscan2.c from Andras Major.


This is the source code for a SANE backend for the Nikon LS-5000 ED
(Coolscan 5000 ED) scanner.

The LS-5000 is a 35mm film scanner capable of 4000dpi resolution and
16-bit colour depth.

The ls5000.c file is based on coolscan2.c from the SANE distribution.
I have heavily cleaned it up, modernized the code, made it worked with
the LS-5000 and added a few features. It should be possible to factor
in support for the other scanners again, but I have not made any attempt
at it yet since I do now own any such hardware.
The sanei* files were copied from the SANE distribution and slightly
modified for building outside of the SANE source.



 Requirements
==============
 * libusb development headers, libsane development headers
   (libusb-dev/libsane-dev or similar)
 * a not-too-shabby C compiler


 Installation
==============
 * add "ls5000" to /etc/sane/dll.conf (or, on Debian systems,
   create /etc/sane/dll.d/ls5000 with just the string ls5000 in it)
 * copy libsane-ls5000.so.1 to /usr/lib/sane/libsane-ls5000.so.1


 Debugging
===========
The ls5000 backend, like most SANE backends, honours the SANE_DEBUG_LS5000
environment variable. There are various debug levels:
      1: most obvious bugs
 2 - 10: some information
     20: command trace
