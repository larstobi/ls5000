As a special exception, the authors of SANE give permission for
additional uses of the libraries contained in this release of SANE.

The exception is that, if you link a SANE library with other files
to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public
License.  Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on
account of linking the SANE library code into it.

This exception does not, however, invalidate any other reasons why
the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public
License.

If you submit changes to SANE to the maintainers to be included in
a subsequent release, you agree by submitting the changes that
those changes may be distributed with this exception intact.

If you write modifications of your own for SANE, it is your choice
whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.
